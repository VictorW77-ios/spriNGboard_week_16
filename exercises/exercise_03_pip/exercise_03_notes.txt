The output when I first tried to run Project C: 
``Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/projects/exercise_03_pip/project_c/runme.py", line 1, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'``

When trying to run Project D, the terminal output the same error message: 
``Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/projects/exercise_03_pip/project_d/runme.py", line 1, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy' `` 

`pip list` in Project C:
Package    Version
---------- -------
numpy      1.24.3
pip        23.1.2
setuptools 65.5.0

`pip list` in Project D: 
Package    Version
---------- -------
[numpy      1.24.3] (originally didn't have numpy installed)
pip        23.1.2
setuptools 65.5.0

- Each env had to have numpy and pip installed independently, as they are separate environments. 

After copying the requirements.txt file to Project D and pip installing the dependencies, Project D ran correctly.
