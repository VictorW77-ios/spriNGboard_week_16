These are my notes for exercise 2:

The terminal output this when I ran python --version: 
The `python' command exists in these Python versions:
  3.6.15
  3.10.9

After setting the environment for project_a, the terminal output version:
Python 3.10.9 

Moving up a directory and running the same version cmd output: 
pyenv: python: command not found
pyenv: version `/pyenv_versions//3.10.9/envs/project_a_env' not installed

The `python' command exists in these Python versions:
  3.6.15
  3.10.9
  project_a_env
